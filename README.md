<a href = "https://twitter.com/0xIntra">Intra</a>, <a href = "https://twitter.com/ThomasPepeson"> History memes</a> & <a href = "https://twitter.com/LeGreentext"> Greentext bot</a>

Twitter wrongfully suspended <a href = "https://twitter.com/LeGreentext"> Greentext bot</a> for ban evasion. <br>
They haven't responded to my appeals, <br>
so I have decided to turn off the bots and move on to other things because apparently, <br>
developing on twitter is pointless.
